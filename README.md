## Objective

The End User Working Group aims to ensure that the distinct and impactful voice of end users is heard in the development and delivery of the technical vision of The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF).

## Vision

The End Users Working Group (WG) represents the interests of public and private sector organizations that primarily consume open source rather than produce it.

We strive to:

- Ensure that the use cases for end user consumption of open-source software are understood and factored into OSSF programs.
- Provide the resources required by end users to develop and implement more efficient and effective strategies, processes, tools, best practices and solutions that secure software supply-chains.
- Provide a forum for learning from the experience and insights of peers.
- Create an End Users Working Group, with representation from key private industry, public sectors, and multiple geographical regions.
- Establish end user representation and active participation in OpenSSF working groups and leadership, both in the TAC and the Governing Board.

## Scope

Based on the objective, mission, and goals above, we look to deliver specific delivereables:

- _Ensure that the use cases for end user consumption of open-source software are understood and factored into OSSF programs._
  - Refine Personas document
  - Develop a high level architecture and threat model of an end user within the supply chain
  - Identify controls/checks of interest to end users when ingesting OSS / vendor software (OSSF Scorecard)

  - Contact list showing multiple Linux Foundation groups contacted, individual companies also contacted
